# Frequently asked questions:

**Q**: I have doubts about whether you'll discuss and think which project is good 
and which is bad. Will you be doing that?

**A**: We won't. It will be tough to choose 16 of 100-200 projects, cause we know 
(and you know better) that all projects are great, and they're all useful, simply because you 
were brave enough to share your creations with us. Therefore, this is the most beautiful part of 
this, don't you think?

---

**Q**: I'm thinking whether I should start writing something fresh for this summit, which
I think would be very-very cool and bright. Should I do that?

**A**: Great! Take your time until the 1st of August. We're waiting for your submissions 24/7!

---

**Q**: I just want to attend KaiCode, but I don't know anyone with GitHub who has 
booked his seat already. How can I join the summit?

**A**: Don't worry, just join our [Telegram group](https://t.me/kaicode) and mention `@yegor256` 
in your message. He'll help you with that!

---

**Q**:  I'm not from Moscow. Can I participate in spite of it?

**A**:  It's not a problem, closer to August we'll help you book some nice variants to stay 
at night, we're working now to get you the most comfortable place in the city 
(and the closest to the summit itself).

---

**Q**:  Is it possible to present or attend KaiCode online? 

**A**:  Yes, it is! However, we're hoping to see you all in real life.
